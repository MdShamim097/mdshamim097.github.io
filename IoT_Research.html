					<h2>Abstract</h2>
					<p>
						Despite the significant benefits of the widespread
						adoption of smart home Internet of Things (IoT) devices, these
						devices are known to be vulnerable to active and passive attacks.
						Existing literature has demonstrated the ability to infer the
						activities of these devices by analyzing their network traffic. In
						this study, we introduce a packet-based signature generation and
						detection system that can identify specific events associated with
						IoT devices by extracting simple features from raw encrypted
						network traffic. Our approach addresses limitations in existing
						state-of-the-art techniques, which rely on specific packet intervals. 
						Our proposed approach is not interval dependent rather, it
						automatically identifies the specific threshold of packets to consider 
						to generate a unique signature and, thus, is more resilient
						to network jitters. Furthermore, we evaluate the effectiveness,
						uniqueness, and correctness of our signatures by training and
						testing our system using four public datasets. During this
						evaluation, we not only verify known signatures but also identify
						new ones. Additionally, our system achieves an average recall
						and precision of 98-99% and 98-100%, respectively, highlighting
						both the effectiveness of our approach and the feasibility of using
						packet-level signatures in detecting user activities of IoT devices.

					<h2>System Architecture</h2>
					Our system includes three key stages:			
					<ol>
							<li>Input processing</li>
							<li>Training</li>
							<li>Activity detection</li>
						</ol>
						<br/><img src="img/researches/r1/Overview-new.png" style="width: 60vw; min-width: 330px; border: 1px solid #9fbcbda2; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;" class="rounded" alt="">
					<br/>
					<h3>Stage-1: Input Processing</h3>
					At first, we take a device’s event types & triggered events of that type as input. For convenience, 
					we consider each event type as a decimal number.
						<br/><img src="img/researches/r1/stage1.png" style="width: 10vw; border: 1px solid #9fbcbda2; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;" class="rounded" alt="">
					<br/>
					<h3>Stage-2: Training</h3>
					<p><i><b style="color: rgb(89, 89, 132);">Data Collection.</b></i>To collect a training set, we first start tcpdump on the router’s local interfaces
					and start the script. Then, we terminate tcpdump after the n<sup style="color: rgb(89, 89, 132);">th</sup> event has been issued. 
					</p>
					<p><i><b style="color: rgb(89, 89, 132);">Trace Filtering.</b></i>TWe filter the collected raw training set (a
					set of pcap files and event timestamps) to discard unrelated traffic. We discard the packets where neither the source nor
					destination IP matches. Also, the packets beyond the number of packets <i>n</i> (a threshold described later on) after each
					timestamped event are discarded.
					</p> 
					<p><i><b style="color: rgb(89, 89, 132);">Pair Clustering.</b></i> In this step, we separate relevant packet
					pairs (i.e., those that consistently occur after an event) from irrelevant ones. Since we do not know in advance the packet
					lengths in pairs, an unsupervised learning algorithm: DBSCAN (Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is used.
					</p>
					<p>
					<i><b style="color: rgb(89, 89, 132);">Signature Creation.</b></i> Signatures in this paper are identified
					based on only two parameters: packet-length and direction. To
					create a signature, we concatenate packet pairs in the clusters
					to reassemble the longest packet sequences possible. Packet
					pairs in clusters x and y are concatenated if, and only if, for
					each packet pair px in x, there exists a packet pair py in y
					such that px and py occurred consecutively in the same TCP
					connection. If there are more pairs in y than in x, the extra
					pairs in y are discarded. Finally, this system sorts the sets of
					packet sequences based on the total number of packets to form
					a list of packet sequence sets.
					</p>
					<p>
					<i><b style="color: rgb(89, 89, 132);">Signature Validation.</b></i>The validation of the signatures is
					done by running the detection algorithm at layer-3 using the
					dataset on which signatures are created. If the system detects
					at most n events, and the timestamps of detected events match
					the timestamps for events recorded during training, then the
					signature is finalized as a valid packet-level signature.

					</p>
					<i><b style="color: rgb(89, 89, 132);">Heuristics.</b></i> Heuristic is used in both signature generation and
					validation. At first, we find out the number of packets, n<sub style="color: rgb(89, 89, 132);">i</sub>, of each triggered event for a specific time interval ‘t’, where
					i = 1, 2, . . . , m (empirically we set, m = 100 and t = 15 milliseconds). Then, we calculate the geometric mean of all
					the ni, which is the number of packets (n) we have considered
					for our system. If events are triggered m times during training phase and
					the number of packets for triggered events i = 1, 2, . . . , m are
					n<sub style="color: rgb(89, 89, 132);">1</sub>1, n<sub style="color: rgb(89, 89, 132);">2</sub>, . . . , n<sub style="color: rgb(89, 89, 132);">m</sub>, respectively, then the number of packets to be
					considered will be: <br/>

					<h3> Stage-3 (Activity Detection):</h3>Detection is done on independent datasets from which we did not generate signatures. We treat a network trace as a stream of packets. Each
					individual packet is presented to a set of state machines.
					A state machine is maintained for each packet sequence of the signature for each flow. A state
					machine advances to its next state if the packet matches the
					next packet in the modeled packet sequence. Heuristic is used here too.

					<h2>Examples of Signature</h2>
					We identify signatures based on only two parameters: packet-length and direction. 
					For the Sengled bulb, we do not observe any
					pattern in its own communication. However, for ON events,
					the controlling smartphone always sends a request packet of
					length 211 bytes to an Internet host and receives a reply packet
					of length 1063 bytes. For OFF, these packets are of the same
					lengths. We observe an exchange of TLS Application Data
					packets between the Amazon plug and an Internet host where
					the packet lengths are 1099 bytes and 235 bytes when the plug
					is ON. For OFF events, we find consistently occurring packet
					pairs in the plug’s communication with two different Internet
					hosts where the lengths of the reply packets are the same; but
					for the requests packets, the lengths are different. Similarly, for
					the TP-Link bulb, we observe that smartphone sends a request
					packet to the device with the same lengths of packets for both
					events, and the reply packets from the device are of lengths
					227 bytes and 244 bytes for corresponding events. Thus, this
					request-reply pattern can occur in the communication of any of
					the three pairs: Phone-Device, Device-Cloud, or Phone-Cloud.

					<h2>Results Summary</h2>
					We have explored and designed how encrypted traffic from IoT devices can be
					used to infer sensitive information, such as, events of those devices and sensors. Specifically, we
					have implemented a methodology (a packet-based signature generation, validation and detection system) for automatically extracting packet-level signatures for smart home device events
					from their network traffic. We have identified some new packet-level signatures that were not
					previously known. Then, through experimental evaluations based on a wide range of different IoT devices from a real smart home environment, we have demonstrated that our system
					is able to accurately unveil IoT device activities from raw network traffic logs with an average
					recall of 98∼99% . Finally, we have evaluated the uniqueness of the generated signatures by
					performing signature detection on different independent dataset and the results were much satisfactory. Through these efforts, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of our system to detect
					user activities of IoT devices.

					This research presents a system which is capable of detecting user activities of heterogeneous
					IoT devices with the help of packet-level signatures extracted from both unencrypted and encrypted network traffic. Our system successfully overcomes some limitations of the existing
					system as described previous chapters. However, IoT traffic analysis and user activity detection
					is a vast area of research and different ideas are still needed to study and implement in this
					sector. Our contribution of “packet-based signature generation & detection” can be combined
					with these new ideas and we believe that it will increase the accuracy of any IoT user activity
					detection system tremendously.

					<h2>Contributions</h2>
					We introduce a packet-based signature generation and detection system that does not consider a temporal
					threshold and can efficiently handle both binary and multitype events. Our system overcomes these limitations as we
					experiment with a diverse range of smart home devices and
					use only the packet length and direction for a specific number
					of packets, simplifying the detection technique and achieving
					higher recall and precision rates. We make the following contributions:
					<ul>
						<li>To generate and detect packet-level signatures, we devise
							a threshold on the number of packets to consider for
							the signature rather than depending on a specific time
							interval. As time-based signature generation and detection
							can be easily manipulated by slowing down or speeding
							up the traffic rate, existing works are less effective across
							different datasets. Our proposed approach is less prone
							to temporal fluctuations caused by network jitters.</li>
							<li>
								To the best of our knowledge, we have obtained the
								highest average recall and precision of 98−99% and
								98−100%, respectively, for any packet-level signature
								detection system to date. We will also open-source our
								codebase for the research community.
							</li>
							<li>
								Our automated signature generation process captures <i>new
								signatures</i> from existing datasets, further verified through
								cross-data validations. Thus, signatures can be generated
								for both binary-type and multi-type events in an automated and systematic way without prior knowledge of
								the device’s behavior.
							</li>
					</ul>
